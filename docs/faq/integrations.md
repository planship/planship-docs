### How do I integrate Planship with my product?
Once you define all of your subscription plans in Planship, you can start using the Planship REST API via one of the SDKs that we provide. Planship API allows you to register customers, create/modify/delete their subscriptions, report metered usage, and retrieve their entitlements.

### What languages and frameworks are supported by Planship?
Planship offers Node.js, Python, and Java SDKs today. We continuously add support for new languages and platforms. Please visit https://planship.io/docs/sdks to learn more.

### The language/platform that Iâ€™m using is not on the list - am I out of luck?
No, not at all. We continuously add new SDKs to support more languages. Please contact us at connect@planship.io and let us know what language/platform you use. You can also implement your own client library for the Planship REST API which is documented at https://planship.io/docs/api. Planship API is OpenAPI 3.0 compliant, so you can simply autogenerate the Planship API client using the OpenAPI client generator.
